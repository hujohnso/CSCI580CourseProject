Ideas for HPC: Deep Learning project.
Bo said as a project idea that we should "Simply select an application (such as matrix transposition, SPMV, breadth-first search and so on) and try to beat the state-of-the-art implementation.

Idea 1: Speed up ZCA Whitening for image processing (Maybe holistically see if it helps train a ML application more quickly than tensor flow)
	Description of PCA Whitening if you've never seen it before: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/unsupervised/PCAWhitening/

Idea 2: Work on sliding windows detection (Because the windows overlap it seems ripe for HPC optimization)

	(There is also one of these that has multiple windows per location but I would have to look for it)
	
Idea 3: Residual neural network

Idea 4: Video training we know previous frames are super similar.  
	
	
Data sets we could use to take advantage of for our implementations
